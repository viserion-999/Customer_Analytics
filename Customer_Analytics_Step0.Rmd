#Initial hiccups

###There is a lot of difference from following a tutorial and doing something & trying to get your hands dirty and trying something (small) on your own

###All I was trying to do was reading a excel sheet in R & here is a story of what happened. I am logging this because I saw a lot of posts with the same issue & no proper answer.

###error encountered when trying to install the xlsx package
```{}
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘rJava’:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
  error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so, 6): Library not loaded: @rpath/libjvm.dylib
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so
  Reason: image not found
```

##Solution 1:

### Here is a suggested resolution documented neatly:https://zhiyzuo.github.io/installation-rJava/

###However, when he says to copy the gcc paths to the text editor, do make sure you have gcc installed correctly.

###If you are able to install after following the steps mentioned here - lucky you! My R studio session was crashing when I did a .jinit(). Even running the dyn.load() did no magic.

##Solution 2
###https://gist.github.com/gwinstanley/884d6af25844bdaeb0c81f95bb285768
###this script is magic. You can also find the same script my git commit


###I'll save explaining my data & what I am trying to do in next file but here is what happened when I tried to read my excel file:
```{}
Error in .jcall("RJavaTools", "Ljava/lang/Object;", "invokeMethod", cl,  : 
  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

###Turns out xlsx is not such a great package to read huge xlx files. huh. the irony!!
###So we are using the openxlsx package to read the excel file.

###See you in Customer_Analytics_Step1!!
